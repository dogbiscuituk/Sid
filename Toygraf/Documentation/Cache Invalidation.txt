Several levels of cache invalidation are used in this project, to control and enhance the efficiency
of graphical operations. GDI+ is notorious for slow speed, deriving no help whatsoever from hardware
(GPU) acceleration, so such measures are essential.

1: The PictureBox

    Q. What invalidates the PictureBox?
    A. A call to AppController.InvalidatePictureBox().
    Q. What re-validates the PictureBox?
    A. A call to Graph.Draw() in response to a PictureBox.Paint event.

2: The Grid

    Q. What invalidates the Grid?
    A. Almost any change to non-series related Graph properties.
    Q. What re-validates the Grid?
    A. A call to Graph.ValidateGrid().

3: Proxies

    Q. What invalidates the proxies?
    A. Changing the Formula property of any Series in the Graph invalidates all of its proxies.
    Q. What re-validates the proxies?
    A. A call to Graph.ValidateProxies().
